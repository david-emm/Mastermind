This is a text based version of MasterMind written in Python 3
to run in a Linux terminal. (python3 mastermind.py). The following
emoticons ğŸ”´ ğŸŸ  ğŸŸ¢ ğŸ”µ ğŸŸ£ ğŸŸ¡ âš« âšª ğŸŸ¤ are used to represent the
coloured pegs. The code uses the Python curses routines to display
the player's guesses and the program's help responses. The program
relies on the Linux terminal's font being able to display the 
emoticons correctly. This is not a mouse based implementation.
